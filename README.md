# Binary Search Tree Operations in Java

This project is an implementation of basic Binary Search Tree (BST) operations in Java. The BST data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various applications due to its efficient searching and sorting capabilities.

## Features

- **Insertion:** Insert a new node into the BST while maintaining the binary search tree property.
- **Deletion:** *Not implemented yet.*
- **Search:** *Not implemented yet.*
- **Traversal:** Implemented in-order traversal.
- **Height Calculation:** *Not implemented yet.*
- **Balanced BST:** *Not implemented yet.*
- **Iterative Insertion and Traversal:** *Not implemented yet.*
- **Validation:** Implemented input validation for insertion.
- **Optimizations:** *Not implemented yet.*
- **Error Handling:** Implemented input validation to handle invalid input during insertion.
